# Password Generator & Strength Checker

This project is a simple password generator and strength checker built with Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to:

- Generate a random password with a length between 8 to 16 characters.
- Check if the generated password contains at least one special character (`!@#$%^&*()`).
- Reset the application and exit when desired.

### Features:
